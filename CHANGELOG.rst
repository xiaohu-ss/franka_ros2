Changelog for package franka_ros2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

v2.7.1 (2026-09-01)
----------

* fix: spine ``~/halt`` and ``move_absolute`` cancel did not stop the carriage.
  ``halt_motion()`` posted to ``/spine/api/motion:halt``, which the device does
  not implement (404). It now uses ``motion:quick-stop``, re-arms to
  ``SwitchedOn`` after the DS402 stop, overlaps halt and feedback with the
  blocking ``motion-mm:start`` on one HTTP client, and does not report a goal
  canceled when halt fails.
* fix: spine ``http_timeout`` (default 3 s) is only the connect timeout and the
  budget for short REST. ``motion-mm:start`` uses ``(http_timeout, 600 s)`` so
  a long move is not aborted by the short read; the motion lock stays held
  until that POST returns.
* refactor: spine REST wire strings live in ``SpineStatus`` (DS402 states) and
  ``SpineMotion`` (``Finished``).
* fix: ``move_absolute`` no longer surfaces HTTP 424 when the spine is not
  ``SwitchedOn``. It checks state first and reports e.g.
  ``Cannot start motion: spine is SwitchedOff (expected SwitchedOn)``.

v2.7.0 (2026-08-14)
----------

* feat: add TMR battery ROS 2 support in ``franka_mobile`` (``sensor_msgs/BatteryState``
  topic at 1 Hz and ``std_srvs/Trigger`` services for wireless charging), with an
  internal ``franka_desk_api`` HTTPS helper used by the spine and battery clients.
* fix: franka_hardware tests now run in isolated ROS domains to avoid possible collisions.
* fix: fixed franka_hardware stop motion test to check for stopping_joint_positions matching the last 
        commanded target instead of zero positions. 

v2.6.0 (2026-08-10)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.8.1 requires ROS 2 Humble

* fix: tune mobile teleop velocity/acceleration limits to stay within the RCU
  2-norm bounds. Raise swerve translational limits to 0.35 m/s / 0.4 m/s^2 and
  rotational to 0.5 rad/s / 0.3 rad/s^2 in ``controllers.yaml``, rescale the xbox
  normal/turbo axes in ``xbox.config.yaml`` to match ``max_velocity``, and reduce
  the joystick deadzone (0.1) with a higher autorepeat rate (50 Hz) in
  ``mobile_teleop.launch.py`` for smoother teleop.
* test: add a no-hardware integration test suite: a fake-hardware FR3
  controller-lifecycle test, a Joy→cmd_vel teleop test, a launch-file parsing test,
  a MoveIt planning smoke test with a gripper name-consistency check, and a single
  GTest that loads every example controller. ``moveit.launch.py`` gains a
  ``use_rviz`` argument so the smoke test can run headless. The CI test stage
  now selects ``franka_bringup``, which the package filter had excluded, so its
  tests are executed rather than only built.
* fix: align MoveIt gripper controller name with actual gripper node name.
  ``fr3_controllers.yaml`` and ``moveit.launch.py`` referenced ``fr3_gripper``
  but the node is launched as ``franka_gripper``, breaking gripper action commands
  and joint state aggregation in MoveIt. (GitHub PR #206)
* fix: add missing dependencies in package.xml for isolated builds
  (``rclcpp_components`` in franka_hardware; ``rclcpp_lifecycle``, ``urdf``,
  ``eigen`` in franka_semantic_components). Fixes rosdep-based fresh-environment
  builds. (community contribution: GitHub PRs #96, #169)
* refactor: **BREAKING CHANGE** decouple the simulation backend (real/mock/gazebo) from the
  franka_hardware ros2_control macros (``franka_arm`` and ``tmrv0_2``). The hardware
  ``<plugin>`` block and the gz_ros2_control ``<gazebo>`` system element are now
  injected by the owning package (``franka_bringup`` for real/mock,
  ``franka_gazebo_bringup`` for gazebo) instead of being selected by ``xacro:if``
  inside franka_hardware. Mode/interface selection moved to the entry-point URDFs as
  capability flags (``include_effort_command``, ``include_finger_joint``,
  ``include_passive_base``), replacing the former ``gazebo`` / ``gazebo_effort``
  flags. URDF expansions remain behavior-equivalent.
* fix: collapse five duplicate top-level ``/**:`` keys in franka_gazebo_bringup's
  ``franka_gazebo_controllers.yaml`` into one. YAML last-key-wins was silently
  dropping the controller_manager type declarations, blocking the tmr gazebo launch.

v2.5.1 (2026-07-07)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.8.0 requires ROS 2 Humble

* feat: add tmr launch file in franka bringup and use it for the mobile teleop launch file
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.8.0 requires ROS 2 Humble

* feat: franka_gazebo: add robot model, full ``franka::RobotState`` and estimated
  external-wrench (tcp force/torque) state interfaces to the gz_ros2_control system
  plugin, so model-based and force/torque controllers activate in simulation like on
  hardware. The plugin is renamed ``franka_gazebo_hardware/FrankaGazeboHardwareInterface``.
* fix: franka_hardware: set the gz_ros2_control plugin ``<ros><namespace>`` for the
  mobile robot (tmrv0_2) so the controller_manager comes up in the ``/mobile_base``
  namespace and controllers load in simulation instead of the launch hanging on
  ``robot_state_publisher service not available``.
* feat: franka_gazebo: the simulated external wrench is expressed in the stiffness frame K
  (``K_F_ext_hat_K`` and the ``_tcp`` force/torque interfaces), while ``O_F_ext_hat_K``
  stays in the base frame; the wrench sign follows the reaction convention (a push in +x
  reads a measured external force of -x).
* feat: franka_gazebo: export the 16 ``<i>/cartesian_pose_state`` state interfaces from the
  gz_ros2_control system plugin, so Cartesian-pose controllers activate in simulation like
  on hardware.

v2.5.0 (2026-06-23)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.8.0 requires ROS 2 Humble

* chore: split the gazebo sources into two packages, ``franka_gazebo_bringup``
  (launch files, worlds, robot descriptions, controller configs) and
  ``franka_gazebo_hardware`` (the gz_ros2_control gravity-compensation system plugin,
  ``franka_gazebo_hardware/GazeboGravityCompensationSystem``). The public
  ``ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup ...`` command is unchanged.
* fix: franka_gazebo_bringup: fix launch file for gazebo (use world without gravity by default for example controllers)
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.7.0 requires ROS 2 Humble
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.8.0(?) requires ROS 2 Jazzy

* feat: expose ``K_F_ext_hat_K`` as ``ForceTorqueSensor`` state interfaces (force.x/y/z,
  torque.x/y/z) on the ``<arm_prefix><robot_type>_tcp`` sensor, enabling direct wrench
  consumption at control frequency without a topic bridge.
* BREAKING CHANGE: collision_detected topic now uses best_effort QoS (SensorDataQoS);
  thread-safe atomics for collision state in example controllers.
  Subscribers using the default ``reliable`` QoS will no longer receive messages.
  To migrate, set the subscriber QoS to ``best_effort`` (``SensorDataQoS``):

* feat: Added franka_spine packages (franka_spine_msgs, franka_spine_server, franka_spine_examples) — ROS 2 action/service server for controlling the Franka Spine module
* docu: Added documentation for error recovery after an FCI error.
* refactor: Removed the dead ``auto_declare<std::string>("robot_description", "")`` parameter from the joint position/velocity example controllers - the URDF is obtained from robot_state_publisher via the parameters client, so the declaration was unused.
* chore: devcontainer container name now derives from the workspace folder basename (``<folder>_humble``) so variant clones no longer collide on a fixed container name.

v2.4.0 (2026-05-04)
-------------------
Requires libfranka >= 0.20.4 and franka_description >= 2.7.0 requires ROS 2 Humble

* breaking change: Switching franka_description common package both for humble and jazzy -> 2.7.0
* chore: refactored cartesian velocity example controller to be gazebo independent by chaining `swerve_ik_controller`
* feat: added a model-based gravity-compensation system plugin
  (``franka_gazebo_bringup::GazeboGravityCompensationSystem``) for gz_ros2_control that
  injects pinocchio-computed gravity torque on the effort-controlled arm joints, so the
  zero-torque example controllers behave in Gazebo as on the real robot (where the master
  controller performs gravity compensation) instead of collapsing under gravity.
* chore: removed the per-link ``<gravity>false</gravity>`` xacro overrides; gravity is now
  enabled globally in the Gazebo world. This is engine-independent (the previous approach
  relied on a gz-fortress gravity-disable behavior that is not forwarded by some physics
  engines). Simulation-only behavior change; no impact on real-robot users.
* docu: Maintenance work on documentation
* feat: Added `franka_mobile` package with `swerve_drive_controller` (tf and odom support) and `swerve_ik_controller` for gazebo sim.
* refactor: replace blocking mutex in franka_robot_state_broadcaster with lock-free AsyncBuffer
* BREAKING CHANGE: franka_robot_state_broadcaster convenience topics are published with best_effort QoS.
  Topics affected: ``current_pose``, ``stiffness_frame_wrench``, and all other convenience topics
  from the broadcaster. Subscribers using the default ``reliable`` QoS will no longer receive
  messages. To migrate, set the subscriber QoS to ``best_effort``:

  **C++ (rclcpp)**

  .. code-block:: cpp

     // Before (default reliable QoS — no longer receives messages):
     auto sub = node->create_subscription<geometry_msgs::msg::PoseStamped>(
         "current_pose", 10, callback);

     // After (best_effort QoS):
     rclcpp::QoS qos(10);
     qos.best_effort();
     auto sub = node->create_subscription<geometry_msgs::msg::PoseStamped>(
         "current_pose", qos, callback);

  **Python (rclpy)**

  .. code-block:: python

     # Before (default reliable QoS — no longer receives messages):
     self.create_subscription(PoseStamped, 'current_pose', callback, 10)

     # After (best_effort QoS):
     from rclpy.qos import QoSProfile, ReliabilityPolicy
     qos = QoSProfile(depth=10, reliability=ReliabilityPolicy.BEST_EFFORT)
     self.create_subscription(PoseStamped, 'current_pose', callback, qos)

* fix: test fr3 urdf updated and segmentation fault errors from unit tests fixed
* fix: make FrankaHardwareInterface error recoverable
* refactor: FrankaHardwareInterface to use enums for the control mode
* fix: ActionServers crashing when exception is not caught

v2.3.0 (2026-03-10)
