franka_gazebo_bringup
=====================

.. important::

    Minimum necessary `franka_description` version is 0.3.0.
    You can clone franka_description package from https://github.com/frankarobotics/franka_description.

A project integrating Franka ROS 2 with the Gazebo simulator.

Launch RVIZ + Gazebo
--------------------

Launch an example which spawns RVIZ and Gazebo showing the robot:


.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py

If you want to display another robot, you can define the robot_type:

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py robot_type:=fp3

If you want to start the simulation including the franka_hand:

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup visualize_franka_robot.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand'

Joint Velocity Control Example with Gazebo
-------------------------------------------

Before starting, be sure to build `franka_example_controllers` and `franka_description` packages.
`franka_description` must have the minimum version of 0.3.0.


.. code-block:: shell

    colcon build --packages-select franka_example_controllers


Now you can launch the velocity example with Gazebo simulator.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_franka_arm_example_controller.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand' controller:='joint_velocity_example_controller'


Keep in mind that the gripper joint has a bug with the joint velocity controller.
If you are interested in controlling the gripper please use joint position interface.


Joint Position Control Example with Gazebo
-------------------------------------------

To run the joint position control example you need to have the required software listed in the joint velocity control section.

Then you can run with the following command.

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_franka_arm_example_controller.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand' controller:='joint_position_example_controller'


Joint Impedance Control Example with Gazebo
--------------------------------------------

For running torque example:

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_franka_arm_example_controller.launch.py load_gripper:=true franka_hand:='franka_hand' controller:='joint_impedance_example_controller'


Mobile Robot Example with Gazebo
---------------------------------

Launch the TMR mobile base in Gazebo:

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_mobile_robot.launch.py

With sensors enabled:

.. code-block:: shell

    ros2 launch franka_gazebo_bringup gazebo_mobile_robot.launch.py with_sensors:=true


Gravity Compensation in Simulation
----------------------------------

Gravity is enabled globally in the Gazebo world, just like on the real robot. To keep the
arms from collapsing under their own weight, ``franka_gazebo_bringup`` loads a
gravity-compensation system plugin (provided by ``franka_gazebo_hardware``) that computes
the model-based gravity torque and applies it to the effort-controlled arm joints. This mirrors the real robot, where the master
controller performs gravity compensation, so the zero-torque example controllers (for
example the joint impedance controller) behave the same way in simulation as on hardware.

You normally don't need to configure any of this — it is wired up by the example launch
files. Gravity being enabled is engine-independent and does not depend on a particular
physics engine forwarding a gravity-disable flag.

Simulated Robot State and Interfaces
------------------------------------

The Gazebo hardware interface publishes a faithful ``franka::RobotState`` and exports the
same state interfaces as the real hardware, so model-based controllers, gravity compensation
and Cartesian-pose controllers work in simulation just as they do on the robot. The exported
state interfaces are:

* ``robot_model`` and ``robot_state`` — the full model and state surface;
* the ``_tcp`` force/torque interfaces — the estimated external wrench at the TCP;
* the 16 ``<i>/cartesian_pose_state`` interfaces — the current Cartesian pose, so
  Cartesian-pose controllers can activate in simulation.

The estimated external wrench is reported in two frames: ``O_F_ext_hat_K`` is expressed in
the base frame and ``K_F_ext_hat_K`` in the stiffness frame K. The wrench sign follows the
reaction convention — a push in +x reads a measured external force of -x.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you experience that Gazebo can't find your model files, try to include the workspace. E.g.


.. code-block:: shell

    export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=${GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH}:/workspaces/src/
